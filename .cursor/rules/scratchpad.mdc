# Work Phase Scratchpad Memory File

[scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) exists as your **session context** for the current work. It's a lightweight, focused view of what you're doing right now.

**Important**: Detailed implementation history belongs in individual story files (see `build-story.md` command). The scratchpad is for active session context only, not a complete history repository.

Suggested structure for [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md):
- **Current Story**: Link to the story you're currently working on from `/docs/stories.md`
- **Current Task**: Brief description of what you're working on this moment
- **Plan Checklist**: Quick checklist of work required for the current task/story
- **Issues/Blockers**: Active issues or blockers right now
- **Decisions Made**: Recent decisions that affect current work (detailed decisions go in story work logs)

If [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) is missing any of these sections, restore them immediately. Never remove this structure.

### Instructions
- Always add tasks as checklists so they can be tracked.
- Follow `project-management.mdc` for work-specific instructions.
- Use [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) for **current session context** - what you're doing right now.
- Detailed implementation history (attempts, failures, solutions) should go in story work logs (see `build-story.md` command).
- Frequently suggest to the user what the next obvious steps are and suggest the most logical one.
- Reorganize [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) now and then, putting unfinished tasks at the top and finished ones at the bottom.
- Update `/docs/stories.md` with story statuses and progress.
- **Archive scratchpad only on phase transitions or major milestones** (not after every task). Detailed history is preserved in story work logs.
- When starting a new story, reset or update [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) to focus on the new work. Previous story details are in that story's work log.

Keep it concise (<300 lines): summarize or remove outdated info regularly to prevent overloading the context. Focus on the current session and immediate next steps.
