# Scratchpad Memory File

[scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) is your external memory for tracking the project's current phase, tasks, and progress.

**MANDATORY**: Read [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) at the start of every interaction to determine the "Current Phase" and "Current Task."

---

### Phase-Specific Instructions

#### If "Current Phase" is "Requirements":
- Focus on gathering and documenting project requirements.
- Use [requirements-template.md](mdc:docs/templates/requirements-template.md) to create [requirements.md](mdc:docs/requirements.md).
- Summarize user input in @requirements.md and log raw input in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) under "User Input."
- Once complete, ask: "Are you satisfied with the requirements? Ready to choose a project type?"

#### If "Current Phase" is "Choose Project Type":
- Suggest a project type based on [requirements.md](mdc:docs/requirements.md).
- List available types from `/bootstrapping/project-types/` (e.g., programming, research).
- After user selection, copy templates from `/bootstrapping/project-types/[type]/templates/` to `/docs/` using a script.
- Update [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) with setup steps from `/bootstrapping/project-types/[type]/manifest.json`.

#### If "Current Phase" is "Project Setup":
- Follow the setup steps listed in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md).
- Use templates in `/docs/` to guide the user through each step.
- Check off steps as completed.
- Once all steps are complete, ask: "Setup is complete. Ready to start building?"

#### If "Current Phase" is "Build":
- Copy `/bootstrapping/project-types/[type]/rules/project-management.mdc` to `.cursor/rules/project-management.mdc`.
- Focus on Build tasks (e.g., coding, research tasks).
- Update [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) with progress.

### Handling User Input
- If the user provides detailed specs, log them in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) under "User Input" and extract info for the current phase.
- If the user requests to skip phases, remind them of the process but offer a "quick setup" option if appropriate.

### Updating @scratchpad.md
- Modify only relevant sections (e.g., checking off tasks).
- Do not overwrite the entire file or remove instructions.
- If lost, re-read [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) and ask the user for clarification.
