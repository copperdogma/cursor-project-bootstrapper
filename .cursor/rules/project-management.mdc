# Project Management Rules

## Initial Interaction
- **At the start of evry conversation**, check the "Current Phase" in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md).
- If the phase is "Bootstrapping: Not started," guide the user through setup steps outlined in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) before proceeding.
- Otherwise, proceed with tasks based on the current phase.

## Phases
- **Bootstrapping**: Set up the project foundation.  
- **Building**: Implement features through stories.  
- **Maintenance**: Handle updates and improvements.  
- Update "Current Phase" in `scratchpad.md` to transition phases.

## File Layout
- `/docs`: Contains `work.md`, `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `architecture.md`, an- `/bootstrapping`: Holds templates for new documents and stories.
- [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md): Tracks current tasks, issues, and decisions.

## Workflow

### Starting a New Story
- Review `work.md` for priorities or dependencies.
- Create a new story file in `/docs/stories` using `story-template.md`.
- Add the story to `work.md` with ID, title, status, and link.
- Update `scratchpad.md` with the new task.

### Working on a Story
- Log progress in the story file and `scratchpad.md`.
- Update the storyâ€™s status in `work.md` as you work.

### Completing a Story
- Verify the story meets its acceptance criteria.
- Test the work (e.g., code, research, documentation).
- Update the story file with final notes.
- Mark the story as "Done" in `work.md`.
- Ask the user to confirm completion.
- Suggest the next story or task.

### Handling Issues
- Log problems in `scratchpad.md` under "Issues or Blockers."
- Seek user input to resolve issues when needed.

## User Interaction
- Confirm with the user before starting new stories or changing phases.
- Ask for approval after completing stories or major tasks.

## Scratchpad Use
- Check [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) at the start of any interaction for the "Current Phase" and current tasks.
- Update it with phase changes, decisions, and progress.
