**Notes -- DO NOT REMOVE**
- This document focuses on WHAT the system should do and WHY, not HOW it should be implemented.
- When recording requirements that go beyond high-level requirements this document, refer back to `scratchpad.mdc`. Should we transition to the next phase? `scratchpad.mdc` will explain what script to run to do that.
