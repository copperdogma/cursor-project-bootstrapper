# Project Requirements

**START CRITICAL NOTES -- DO NOT REMOVE**
- This document focuses on WHAT the system should do and WHY, not HOW it should be implemented.
- Keep this document formatted according to `requitements-template.md`
- When recording requirements that go beyond high-level requirements this document, refer back to `scratchpad.mdc`.
- Ask the user if they should transition to the next phase if:
    - If we have enought requirements for an MVP.
    - If the user is moving past basic requirements into HOW to achieve the project goals.
- `scratchpad.mdc` will explain which script to run to transition to the next phase.
**END CRITICAL NOTES -- DO NOT REMOVE**
