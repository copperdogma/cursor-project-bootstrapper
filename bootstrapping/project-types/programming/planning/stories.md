# Project Stories

[PROJECT TITLE]

**START CRITICAL NOTES -- DO NOT REMOVE**
- This document serves as an index for all story files in `/docs/stories/`, tracking their progress and status.
- Keep this document formatted according to `md`
- Should we transition to the next phase? `scratchpad.mdc` will explain what script to run to do that.
