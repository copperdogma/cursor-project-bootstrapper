# Planning Phase Scratchpad Memory File

[scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) already exists. It tracks the Plaanning Phase tasks and is your external memory. Use it to constntly help you stay on track.

Update it whenever you:
- Start a new task or phase (edit "Current Phase" and "Next Steps").
- Finish an action (log in "Recent Actions," move to "Completed Tasks").
- Hit an issue (add to "Issues or Blockers").
- Make a decision (note in "Decisions Made").

### Instructions
- Use `/docs/templates/design-template.md` to guide the creation of `/docs/design.md`.
- Use `/docs/templates/architecture-template.md` to guide the creation of `/docs/architecture.md`.
- Use `/docs/templates/story-template.md` to prepare initial story files in `/docs/stories/` (e.g., `story-001-implement-oauth-login.md`).
- If `/docs/design.md` or other documents deviate from the expected format, refer back to the templates in `/docs/templates/` to correct them.
- **First Step**: Extract anything from [requirements.md](mdc:docs/requirements.md) that should go in `/docs/design.md` or `/docs/architecture.md` and move it into those documents.
- **Quick Start**: If the user requests a quick start, use all provided input to draft the documents, make assumptions where needed, and ask the user to confirm them.
- Once all tasks in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) are checked off, ask: "Are you ready to move to the Project Setup phase?"

### Transition
- When the user confirms they're ready to move to the Project Setup phase, run the shell command `./bootstrapping/scripts/transition_to_execute.sh programming project-setup`
    - This will copy all files to the correct places to start the Project Setup phase.

### Guard Clause
**MANDATORY**: You CANNOT proceed to the next phase unless ALL tasks in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) are checked off as complete.
