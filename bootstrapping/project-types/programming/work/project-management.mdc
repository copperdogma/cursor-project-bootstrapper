# Programming Project Management

## Overview
This file provides guidance for managing projects starting from the Building phase, after the project type is selected, and continuing into the Maintenance phase.

This document is used to guide project planning, management, and execution.

---

## Phases
- **Building**: Implement features and functionality through stories.
- **Maintenance**: Manage updates, bug fixes, and improvements.
---

## File Layout
- `/docs`:  
  - [requirements.md](mdc:docs/requirements.md): Defines project requirements. Formatting guidelines in `/docs/templates/requirements-template.md` 
  - `design.md`: Outlines design details. Formatting guidelines in `/docs/templates/design-template.md`
  - `architecture.md`: Specifies architectural guidelines. Formatting guidelines in `/docs/templates/design-architecture.md` 
  - `stories.md`: Lists all stories with IDs, titles, statuses, and links. Formatting guidelines in `/docs/templates/design-stories.md`
  - `/docs/stories/`: Contains individual story files.  
- `/docs/templates/`:  
  - `story-template.md`: Template for new story files.  
  - `stories-template.md`: Template for maintaining `/docs/stories.md`.

---

## Workflow

### Building Phase
- **Story Management**:  
  - Create new stories in `/docs/stories/` using `/docs/templates/story-template.md`.  
  - Add each story to `/docs/stories.md` with a unique ID, title, status, and link.  
  - Update statuses in `/docs/stories.md` as work progresses (e.g., "In Progress," "Done").  
  - Use the `build-story.md` command to work on stories - it maintains work logs within story files for complete implementation history.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Write code following `/docs/architecture.md`, `/docs/design.md`, and `@requirements.md`.  
- **Progress Tracking**:  
  - Log detailed implementation history in story work logs (see `build-story.md` command).  
  - Check `docs/stories.md` to identify the current active story (status: "In Progress").  
  - Review the active story's work log for current task, progress, and blockers.  
  - Reflect status changes in `/docs/stories.md`.  
- **Completion**:  
  - Test the implementation (e.g., run code, verify functionality).  
  - Update the story file with final notes in the work log section.  
  - Mark the story as "Done" in `/docs/stories.md`.  
  - Confirm completion with the user and suggest the next story or phase transition.

### Maintenance Phase
- Create new stories for updates or fixes using `/docs/templates/story-template.md`.  
- Follow the Building phase workflow to manage and complete maintenance tasks.

---

## Environment Management
- Install necessary packages or tools during Building or Maintenance.  
- Make a permanent record in `/docs/architecture.md`
- Document significant decisions in the active story's work log (see `build-story.md` command).

---

## Handling Changes
- For new requirements or updates:  
  - Revise `/docs/requirements.md`, `/docs/design.md`, and `/docs/architecture.md` as needed.  
  - Add new stories to `/docs/stories/` and `/docs/stories.md`.  
  - Log significant decisions in the relevant story's work log.

---

## User Interaction
- Confirm story starts, completions, or phase changes with the user.  
- Log user feedback or significant decisions in the relevant story's work log.

---

## Finding Current Work Context
- Start each interaction by checking `docs/stories.md` to identify the active story (status: "In Progress").  
- Review the active story file's work log for:  
  - Current task and progress.  
  - Recent actions and outcomes.  
  - Issues or blockers.  
  - Next steps.
- All implementation history, decisions, and progress should be logged in story work logs (see `build-story.md` command).
