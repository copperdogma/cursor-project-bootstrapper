# Programming Project Management

## Build Phase Workflow
- Use stories to manage development tasks.
- Track stories in `/docs/work.md`.
- Implement code following `/docs/architecture.md`, `/docs/design.md`, and [requirements.md](mdc:docs/requirements.md).

## Story Management
- Use `/docs/templates/stories-template.md` to create `/docs/stories.md` if it doesn't exist.
- Use `/docs/templates/story-template.md` to create new stories in `/docs/stories/`.
- Update `/docs/work.md` with story statuses.
- Confirm story completion with the user.

## Environment Management
- Install packages and configure tools as needed.
- Log changes in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md).

## New Requirements
If the user has new requirements or wants to re-think past decisions, read the following and update them accordingly:
- `/docs/requirements.md` with formatting guidelines in `/docs/templates/requirements-template.md` 
- `/docs/design.md` with formatting guidelines in `/docs/templates/design-template.md`
- `/docs/architecture.md` with formatting guidelines in `/docs/templates/design-architecture.md` 
- `/docs/stories.md` with formatting guidelines in `/docs/templates/design-stories.md`
