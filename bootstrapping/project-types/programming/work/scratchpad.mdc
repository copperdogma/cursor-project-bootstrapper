# Work Phase Scratchpad Memory File

[scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) already exists and is your external memory for your current task. Use it to constantly help you stay on track.

Update it whenever you:
- Start a new task or phase (edit "Current Phase" and "Next Steps").
- Finish an action (log in "Recent Actions," move to "Completed Tasks").
- Hit an issue (add to "Issues or Blockers").
- Make a decision (note in "Decisions Made").

---

### Instructions
- Follow [project-management.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-management.mdc) for work-specific instrucitons.
- Work on the current task in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md).
- Update `/docs/stories.md` with story statuses and progress.
- When the current task is complete, reset [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) and start the next task from `/docs/stories.md`, logging progress in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md).

Keep it concise (<300 lines): summarize or remove outdated info regularly to prevent overloading the context. Focus on the current phase and immediate next steps.
