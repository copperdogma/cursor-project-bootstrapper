# Work Phase Scratchpad Memory File

[scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) already exists and is your external memory for your current task. Use it to constantly help you stay on track.

Suggested structure for [scratchpad.md](mdc:bootstrapping/project-types/programming/work/scratchpad.md):
- **Current Story**: Update with the story you're currently working on from `/docs/stories.md`
- **Current Task**: Update with the specific task you're working on at this moment
- **Plan Checklist**: Maintain a checklist of work required to complete the current task/story
- **Issues/Blockers**: Document any issues that arise during implementation
- **Recently Completed**: Archive tasks that have been completed
- **Decisions Made**: Log important decisions that affect the implementation
- **Lessons Learned**: Document approaches that were tried and failed, and why they failed

### Instructions
- Follow `project-management.mdc` for work-specific instrucitons.
- Work on the current task in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md).
- Frequently suggest to the user what the next obvious steps are and suggest the most logical one.
- Update `/docs/stories.md` with story statuses and progress.
- When the current task is complete reset [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) and start the next task from `/docs/stories.md`, logging progress in [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md).
    - Before erasing [scratchpad.md](mdc:bootstrapping/project-types/programming/work/scratchpad.md), capture any new and essential knowledge from [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) into other documents so it's not lost.

Keep it concise (<300 lines): summarize or remove outdated info regularly to prevent overloading the context. Focus on the current phase and immediate next steps.
