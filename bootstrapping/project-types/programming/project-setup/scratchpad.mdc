# Project Setup Phase Scratchpad Memory File

[scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) already exists. It tracks the Project Setup Phase tasks and is your external memory. Use it to constntly help you stay on track.

Update it whenever you:
- Start a new task or phase (edit "Current Phase" and "Next Steps").
- Finish an action (log in "Recent Actions," move to "Completed Tasks").
- Hit an issue (add to "Issues or Blockers").
- Make a decision (note in "Decisions Made").

### Instructions
- Follow `/docs/architecture.md` to install required packages and configure tools.
- Set up the development environment (e.g., install packages, configure tools).
- If you have questions, first refer back to `/docs/requirements.md` and `/docs/design.md` and if still in doubt ask the user.
- **Quick Start**: If the user requests a quick start, use their input to choose the most appropriate tools and languages, validate with the user, and if the user agrees, install and configure them.
- Once all tasks in @scratchpad.md are checked off, ask: "Are you ready to move to the Work phase?"

### Transition
- Run `./bootstrapping/scripts/transition_to_execute.sh programming work` to move to the next phase.

### Guard Clause
**MANDATORY**: You CANNOT prext phase (work/implementation) unless ALL tasks in @scratchpad.md are checked off as complete.
